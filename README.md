# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to utilize machine learning to identify and predict patterns in heart disease prevalence. Leveraging data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we explore key factors that contribute to heart health and develop models for the early detection and prevention of heart conditions.

## Dataset
The dataset is composed of clinical attributes commonly associated with heart disease and includes 303 instances, each with 13 features. It has been sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, identified by ID=45.

### Attributes Include:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain type (CP)
- Resting Blood Pressure (Trestbps)
- Serum Cholesterol (Chol)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS)
- Resting Electrocardiographic results (Restecg)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (Thalach)
- Exercise Induced Angina (Exang)
- ST depression (Oldpeak)
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Slope)
- Number of major vessels colored by flourosopy (CA)
- Thalassemia (Thal)

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
The data was cleaned, missing values were imputed, and categorical variables were one-hot encoded to prepare for the modeling process. An 80/20 train-test split was used for model evaluation.

### 2. Model Building & Evaluation
We implemented and evaluated two machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate model performance.

### 3. Insights & Discussion
The analysis revealed the complexity of predicting heart disease with initial models achieving modest accuracy. It also highlighted the importance of handling imbalanced data and feature scaling.

## Recommendations for Improvement
- Investigate more sophisticated algorithms and ensemble methods.
- Enhance feature engineering and selection processes.
- Apply extensive hyperparameter tuning.
- Utilize cross-validation techniques for better model performance estimation.

## Ethical Considerations
In deploying machine learning models in healthcare, issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and legal compliance were addressed to ensure ethical application.

## How to Use This Repository
